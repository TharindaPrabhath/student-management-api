Wong\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Unleashing the Next Level of Immersive Gaming\nReviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 256GBVerified Purchase\nThe Meta Quest 2 has revolutionized my gaming experience like never before. This cutting-edge virtual reality headset has completely transformed the way I interact with games, movies, and even social experiences. From the moment I put it on, I was transported to a world of limitless possibilities, making it an absolute must-have for any gaming enthusiast.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me was the Meta Quest 2's stunning display. The high-resolution, fast-switch LCD panels deliver crystal-clear visuals, providing sharp details and vibrant colors that truly immerse you in the virtual environment. Whether I was exploring fantastical realms or engaging in heart-pounding action, the visuals were breathtakingly realistic, pulling me into the gaming world like never before.\n\nThe Quest 2's performance is unparalleled. The powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor, coupled with 6GB of RAM, ensures seamless and lag-free gameplay. I experienced smooth frame rates, minimal loading times, and overall responsiveness that kept me fully engrossed in my gaming adventures.\n\nComfort is a significant factor in any VR headset, and the Meta Quest 2 excels in this department. The lightweight design, ergonomic straps, and soft facial interface provided a comfortable fit even during extended gaming sessions. Additionally, the adjustable IPD (interpupillary distance) settings ensured that I could fine-tune the headset for a custom fit, enhancing the overall comfort and visual experience.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2's Touch controllers are a joy to use. They are incredibly responsive and intuitive, mimicking my hand movements with impressive accuracy. From wielding a virtual sword to manipulating objects in the virtual world, the controllers effortlessly translated my actions into the game, creating a sense of true immersion and control.\n\nThe wireless nature of the Quest 2 is a game-changer. No more tripping over wires or being tethered to a PC; the freedom to move around without any constraints elevated my gaming experience to a whole new level. With its built-in tracking capabilities, I could explore vast virtual worlds without being tied to a specific spot.\n\nThe Quest 2's library of games and experiences is vast and continually growing. From thrilling action titles to captivating exploration games, there's something for every gaming preference. The Meta platform also offers a social space, allowing me to connect with friends and family in virtual reality, bridging the gap between gaming and social interaction.\n\nSetting up the Meta Quest 2 was a breeze. The guided setup process and user-friendly interface made it easy to get started quickly. The headset's integrated guardian system helped create a safe play area, preventing collisions with real-world objects while I was fully engrossed in my virtual adventures.\n\nIn conclusion, the Meta Quest 2 is a game-changing virtual reality headset that has transformed my gaming experience. Its stunning visuals, powerful performance, and comfort-enhancing design immerse me in virtual worlds like never before. With its vast library of games and social interaction features, the Quest 2 has become an essential part of my gaming setup, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their gaming experience to new heights.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning high-resolution display with vibrant colors\n- Powerful performance and smooth gameplay\n- Comfortable and customizable fit\n- Intuitive and responsive Touch controllers\n- Wireless design for unrestricted movement\n- Expansive library of games and social interaction features\n\nCons:\n- Limited battery life during intensive use\n\nOverall, the Meta Quest 2 deserves its place at the forefront of the VR gaming revolution, and it has undoubtedly earned its spot as a flagship device in the virtual reality market.\nRead more\n150 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tEugene W. Maloney\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n A startling, occasionally disquieting virtual reality experience for all\nReviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 128GBVerified Purchase\nFirst, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\nRead more\n4,346 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tJ. Brown\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Amazing Experience\nReviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 128GBVerified Purchase\nSince I got it properly adjusted the headset is comfortable and provides an amazing VR experience. It is completely immersive with fantastic sound quality (not hi fidelity, but music sounds good). My wife walks right by me while I’m playing and I have no idea she’s there.\n\nIt can be a little disorienting at times, so it’s important to have plenty of open space around you. I haven’t tried it sitting down, but that might be a good idea when playing games with more motion/ movement to avoid getting motion sickness.\n\nI’ve only tried a couple different games but the selection appears to be pretty good. Edit: Beat Saber and Moss are two must-haves. Incredible experience in both. PistolWhip is also quite fun.\n\nThe one knock would be the short battery life (I haven’t run it all the way down, but would estimate it at 1-1.5 hours). However, they recommend taking breaks and not playing for too long at any given time. The battery life works in a one-user scenario, but would be too short if you’re sharing the headset between multiple users. Edit: After playing on the headset more I’m finding the battery is lasting longer than I originally thought. After two solid hours of play today I still had a good chunk of battery left. Increased my rating to 5 stars based on this.\n\nOverall, I’m very happy I bought this headset.\nRead more\n26 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nTranslate all reviews to English\n\tBreno Souza\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Funciona muito bem!\nReviewed in Brazil on November 29, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 256GBVerified Purchase\nExcelente custo benefício, além de possibilitar a conexão com o steamvr, podendo \"driblar\" os preços absurdos da loja meta.\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tJesús Elí\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n La mejor opción para iniciar en la Realidad Virtual (RV).\nReviewed in Mexico on July 30, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 256GBVerified Purchase\n Simplemente excelentes, la RV es una experiencia única, las aplicaciones y juegos son totalmente diferentes a lo que estamos acostumbrados.\nLas gafas llegaron totalmente nuevas y con batería, llega con todo lo que dice en la descripción, todo empaquetado y sellado.\nLa batería le dura poco si las usas en sesiones largas pero se entiende por el tamaño y lo que ofrecen, por el contrario las baterías de los controladores le duran mucho más, llevo 2 semanas con ellas y aun tienen un 70% con uso medio alto (con las baterías que vienen incluidas).\nLas usé solas (sin pc) y funcionan excelente, las aplicaciones y juegos van super bien y fluidos, también las probé con pc (cable link) y funcionan genial.\nLas primeras veces de uso marean bastante, pero con el tiempo se acostumbra y se usan con una mayor naturalidad, recomiendo que prueben aplicaciones y juegos de intensidad baja para comenzar y acostumbrase.\nEl único punto malo que le veo es que los juegos y aplicaciones de la tienda de meta son algo más caros que en otras tiendas como Steam, aunque existe una variedad de aplicaciones y juegos gratuitos que te darán un buen rato de diversión aparte de el gran catalogo de paga.\n\n*Para los desarrolladores: Si buscan hacer apps o juegos para este entrono de la RV son una buena elección, las gafas te permiten instalar apps de orígenes desconocidos para poder probar sus creaciones y con las librerías de Unity y otros motores que cuentan con soporte para Oculus es más fácil pasar de lo convencional a la RV.\nRead more\n12 people found this helpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tGrmo\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n No me arrepiento de haber dado el salto al \"metaverso\"\nReviewed in Mexico on June 27, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 128GBVerified Purchase\nLlevo 1 año con el producto y me encantan mis meta quest 2. Realmente tener un producto que tenga una dimensión como experiencia es fascinante, y más aún pensando que es algo que puedes tener en tu recámara y en formato stand alone. Es una pena que poca gente conozca y tenga un dispositivo de estos. Espero que ahora con el anuncio de Apple la gente se anime a comprar dispositivos de realidad virtual /mixta, sobre todo de meta, ya que el dispositivo tiene un precio bastante accesible por una tecnología realmente maravillosa. Definitivamente compraré los meta quest 3 en cuanto salgan y animo a las personas a adquirir una experiencia de estas, no se arrepentirán.\n\nCosas que podrían cambiar en un futuro:\n1. la visión.\nAunque es buena, aún es borrosa y a veces poco clara. Estuve probando y las imágenes dejan de distinguirse con claridad a una distancia de 40 a 60 metros, que es bastante, después de eso las imágenes se tornan borrosas y difíciles de ver. Claro que todo se puede hacer: ver películas, videos, jugar, descansar, etc. La visión no es impedimento de nada, solo podría mejorar bastante. Está característica definitivamente mejora en las quest pro 2 y muy posiblemente en las meta quest 3 cuando salgan.\n\n2. La correa: la correa es muy incómoda. Ajustarla para diferentes personas es tedioso además de que es incómoda en largos periodos de uso y resbala bastante sobre la cabeza. Ocurre que si no está muy apretada a la cabeza (lo cual es muy incómodo), al momento de girar los visores resbalan. La solución es comprar otra correa más cómoda, aunque al principio si te quedas sin dinero por la adquisición tendrás que aguantar un rato con esa correa.\n\n3. Precio de la tienda: los juegos dentro de la tienda de oculus pueden llegar a ser 2 veces más caros que en Steam por ejemplo. Se entiende porque están optimizados para un dispositivo stand alone. No obstante, a veces este precio de verdad puede llegar a estar muy inflado, tanto que podrías preferir comprar la versión de PC y sacrificar un poquito el movimiento libre con un cable tipo c que se conecte a tu PC. Cabe recalcar que el dispositivo cuenta con un sistema que permite la conexión vía WIFI con tu computadora para poder acceder a los juegos de PC sin cable, lo único que necesitas es tener una muy buena conexión dedicada únicamente para los visores. En mi caso preferí conectarlo con cable para tener menos lag.\n\n4. Calor. Después de un uso de aproximadamente 30 - 40 minutos, tal vez un poco más (dependiendo de la aplicación que se esté usando) el dispositivo puede llegar a calentarse haciendo que realmente sudes adentro de los visores. En climas más fríos esto no es problema, pero si vives en un lugar cálido podría llegar a ser bastante incómodo.\n\nEn resumen, las meta quest 2 han Sido unos visores que han cumplido, satisfecho e incluso superado por mucho lo que esperaba del producto. Es una experiencia completa cada vez que te los pones. Siempre es la misma emoción que sientes la primera vez que los usas y más si te aventuras a probar experiencias de diferentes géneros: terror, aventura, sci fi, etc.\nTambién ha Sido una gran herramienta de visualización para cosas de trabajo. Por lo que, las meta quest son más que una consola, son una herramienta para aquellos que quieran usarlas para este enfoque.\n\nRecomiendo ampliamente la adquisición de unos visores.\nRead more\n28 people found this helpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tsangeet khatri\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Well worth the asking price, but can expect some big improvements in the upcoming years..\nReviewed in India on January 6, 2022\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 128GBVerified Purchase\n## Pros:\n- Cheap, Meta is selling at this price probably at a loss to attract more people. 128GB for around 33-35k is a great price.\n- Relatively higher resolution compared to a non-existent competition in this price range.\n- The quality of sensors is top notch. The tracking is extremely accurate.\n- It's relatively lightweight and can run off battery which means no cables. Very convenient and definitely the future direction.\n\n## Areas for improvement:\n\n- The displays could use OLED for better blacks. Though using OLED will hurt longevity so this one gets a pass. Currently blacks are like gray and that is something you will notice if you look for it.\n- The resolution could use an improvement. Again, it's an extremely competitive resolution for the price, but since it's so close to your eyes, even this feels pixelated and low res. It's early VR tech so expect that to improve with time.\n- The battery life is barely 2 hours on a full charge depending on what you're viewing. It's reasonably good, but in the future we could be looking at more efficient devices.\n- There should be a OS level simulated way to rotate when sitting still. It's tedious to have to get up just to rotate to other side of a 360 degree video. Allow simulating that via controls or something on OS level.\n- The headset strap is not comfortable for long wearing sessions. I should not have to spend more money to get a better quality strap. Wearing this device is a primary function and you shouldn't have to buy an accessory to make it better, regardless of the price. Only possible con I an think of, but it gets a pass this time.\n- On a related note, as this tech gets better, I expect components to shrink and this to get lighter and sleeker.\n- Would be nice to not have to create a Facebook account for this, but let's be honest, that's why they're selling this at a loss. To collect more customers and collect your data to target ads at you. That's how they make money, by selling ads and services.\n- Remotely installing apps from mobile is a hit or a miss. Most times it doesn't start downloading and I have to manually trigger app downloads. I think it's a temporary bug which they can easily fix.\n\n## Other notes:\n- Use Firefox reality browser. Way better than default and support ad blocking, multiple window and is also far more convenient and reliable with Web XR experiences.\n- Give Oculus TV a try. It's like YouTube VR but the interface is much nicer and the recommendations are also extremely good.\n- You can cast your Oculus view to your phone. This is super convenient when showing this to a friend or family member. Just cast to your phone so that you have a sense of what your friend/family member is seeing and guide them accordingly.\n\n## Summary:\nGreat stuff honestly. Making VR affordable (regardless of the intentions) also opens it up to more developers across the world and that will only help give us better VR experiences over time. Looking forward to develop some WebXR and native oculus experiences using this.\nRead more\n54 people found this helpful\nReport\n\tEd Win\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n My kid love it!\nReviewed in Singapore on November 6, 2023\nStyle: Headset OnlySize: 128GBVerified Purchase\nWorks very well and very good quality!\nReport\nSee more reviews\nBack to top\nGet to Know Us\nCareers\nAmazon Newsletter\nAbout Amazon\nAccessibility\nSustainability\nPress Center\nInvestor Relations\nAmazon Devices\nAmazon Science\n\t\t\nMake Money with Us\nSell more with Amazon\nSell apps on Amazon\nSupply to Amazon\nProtect & Build Your Brand\nBecome an Affiliate\nBecome a Delivery Driver\nStart a Package Delivery Business\nAdvertise Your Products\nSelf-Publish with Us\nHost an Amazon Hub\n›See More Ways to Make Money\n\t\t\nAmazon Payment Products\nAmazon Visa\nAmazon Store Card\nAmazon Secured Card\nAmazon Business Card\nShop with Points\nCredit Card Marketplace\nReload Your Balance\nGift Cards\nAmazon Currency Converter\n\t\t\nLet Us Help You\nYour Account\nYour Orders\nShipping Rates & Policies\nAmazon Prime\nReturns & Replacements\nManage Your Content and Devices\nRecalls and Product Safety Alerts\nHelp\n \nEnglish United States\nAmazon Music\nStream millions\nof songs\t\tAmazon Ads\nReach customers\nwherever they\nspend their time\t\t6pm\nScore deals\non fashion brands\t\tAbeBooks\nBooks, art\n& collectibles\t\tACX\nAudiobook Publishing\nMade Easy\t\tSell on Amazon\nStart a Selling Account\t\tAmazon Business\nEverything For\nYour Business\n \nAmazon Fresh\nGroceries & More\nRight To Your Door\t\tAmazonGlobal\nShip Orders\nInternationally\t\tHome Services\nExperienced Pros\nHappiness Guarantee\t\tAmazon Web Services\nScalable Cloud\nComputing Services\t\tAudible\nListen to Books & Original\nAudio Performances\t\tBox Office Mojo\nFind Movie\nBox Office Data\t\tGoodreads\nBook reviews\n& recommendations\n \nIMDb\nMovies, TV\n& Celebrities\t\tIMDbPro\nGet Info Entertainment\nProfessionals Need\t\tKindle Direct Publishing\nIndie Digital & Print Publishing\nMade Easy\t\tAmazon Photos\nUnlimited Photo Storage\nFree With Prime\t\tPrime Video Direct\nVideo Distribution\nMade Easy\t\tShopbop\nDesigner\nFashion Brands\t\tAmazon Warehouse\nGreat Deals on\nQuality Used Products\n \nWhole Foods Market\nAmerica’s Healthiest\nGrocery Store\t\tWoot!\nDeals and\nShenanigans\t\tZappos\nShoes &\nClothing\t\tRing\nSmart Home\nSecurity Systems\t\teero WiFi\nStream 4K Video\nin Every Room\t\tBlink\nSmart Security\nfor Every Home\t\tNeighbors App\nReal-Time Crime\n& Safety Alerts\n \n \t\t \t\tAmazon Subscription Boxes\nTop subscription boxes – right to your door\t\tPillPack\nPharmacy Simplified\t\tAmazon Renewed\nLike-new products\nyou can trust\t\t \t\t \nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Notice\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1996-2024, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates"
